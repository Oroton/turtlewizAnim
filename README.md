TurtleWiz

This is a full rpg game originally made by SamLan Cashire over at
http://samlancashire.com/

It has, tile maps, animation, sprite tiles, events, quests, storyline.
Scene changes, inventory system, spells, attacks, health out of the box.

I took his original code, and animated the main sprite which didn't have it orginally.

This is my first real experience with JS

I'm sharing this with someone so hopefully they can read through his code and learn a few things.
Check out his other work.
